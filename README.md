# ibm_OpenFOAM

### Immersed Boundary Library in OpenFOAM for fluid-structure interaction simulations

Remaining Issues:
- Access mesh_ from emesh_ so as to avoid passing mesh_ variable in all major classes' constructors
- Move updateObjectMotionUhlmann/Tobias from IBParticle to corresponding IBMotionSolver class
